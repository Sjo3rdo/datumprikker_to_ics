# datumprikker_to_ics
In the Netherlands appointments are lots of time made with the site datumprikker.nl. When somebody makes a 'datumprikker'  and organizes 24 events then it is quite the task to put all these dates manually into your agenda.

Since I am new to Python programming, this looked like a nice project to improve my Python skills. I tried to make some functions myself and I used the code from (https://github.com/albertyw/csv-ical). Credits to Albertyw!

I managed to get this code working so that it makes a appoinment in your agenda, but I didn't figure out yet, how I could save this as a "whole day event".

If you have any tips so that I can improve my Python-skills please let me know!
