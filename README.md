# datumprikker_to_ics
In the Netherlands appointments are lots of time made with the site datumprikker.nl. When somebody makes a 'datumprikker'  and organizes 24 events then it is quite the task to put all these dates manually into your agenda.

Since I am new to Python programming, this looked like a nice project to improve my Python skills. If you have any tips so that I can improve my Python-skills please let me know!
